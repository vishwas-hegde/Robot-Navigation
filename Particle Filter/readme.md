# Particle Filter

## Refer to [Doc](https://github.com/vishwas-hegde/Robot-Navigation/blob/main/Particle%20Filter/Project%204%20-%20Particle%20Filter.pdf) for project instructions. This projects implements particle filter and compares the performance with UKF.

## Refer to the [pf_visuals.ipynb](https://github.com/vishwas-hegde/Robot-Navigation/blob/main/Particle%20Filter/pf_visuals.ipynb) for the outputs.

1) particle_filter.py - Particle Filter implementation
2) ukf.py - UKF implementation (Predict and Update)
3) observation_model.py - Read the .mat data and create an observation model
4) simulation.py and simulation_ukf.py - Run the simulation for a given data file
5) covariances.py - Compute the covariance
6) plots.py - Plot the estimated data and ground truth data
7) inference.py - Comparing performance of particle filter vs UKF
